**Q1: download the genetics dataset with the ID `GDS807`. Do you get the same objects?** 
We extract the data as before
```{r}
raw_data <- getGEO('GDS807')
eset_data <- GDS2eSet(raw_data, do.log2 = TRUE)
```
We notice that an error regarding NaNs is obtained. This is due to the log transformation working on missing data, but is not a concern as we will filter this out anyway. As an aside, look at Question 1b below for the first steps to running the analysis without log transformtions.

We can check the objects in the `eset_data` object
```{r}
head(eset_data$sample)
table(eset_data$disease.state)
head(eset_data$sample)
```
We have the same objects for the colitis data, but this time we have 32 controls and 28 patients suffering from the disease. 

**Q1 b (additional/optional): do not log transform the data in the steps above and save the output for the later chapters.**
